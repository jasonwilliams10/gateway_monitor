We use gateway computers for our remote-control solution spread out across the U.S. to support traffic for our customers. This monitor allows me to ping the gateways at a set amount of time to make sure they are online. If a gateway goes down or becomes unavailable, the monitor will send an email alert. As long as the gateway is down when the monitor runs, an email is sent with the estimated time it has been down. When the gateway comes back online and the monitor runs again, it will send out an email that the gateway is back up. It will print the status of the network pings on the console and will document any outages and when they are resolved in a log file. This can be done with other email providers or hosts, but I chose to use Proton Mail for this project due to encryption and not having to use the actual email password in the code.
